 #Employee Management System #

State Management: NgRx is used to manage application state effectively, ensuring a predictable state container.
Responsive UI: Built with Angular Material to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Backend: JSON Server serves as the mock backend, allowing for testing and development without a full-scale backend.
Deployment: The JSON Server is deployed on Render, providing a live backend for the application.
